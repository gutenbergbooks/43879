<h2 class="reg">WHY I WAS IMPRESSED TO WRITE A COOK BOOK.</h2>


<p>It must appeal to the judgment of every thinking
man and woman that the human family are more in
need of sound, wholesome advice as to what they
should eat and drink than ever before. The number
of physicians and dentists increases each year at an
alarming rate, but the aches and ills of the suffering
people do not lessen. Thousands of people find
themselves in a deplorable condition, with stomachs
almost worn out, having depended largely upon predigested
foods and a long list of so-called "dyspepsia
cures."</p>

<p>The amount of patent medicines, "sure cures,"
consumed by the people in the United States is
enormous, and is increasing every year. It must
be apparent to all students of the past century that
the people of the present are not enjoying the same
degree of health as our ancestors, nor have we any
assurance that things will improve unless some radical
change is made.</p>

<p>Disease among cattle, poultry, and fish has increased
so alarmingly in the last few years that we
should no longer depend on the animal kingdom for
food. We should look to the grains, nuts, vegetables,
and fruits for a better dietary than can be prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
from the flesh of animals likely to be contaminated
with tuberculosis, cancer, and other diseases.</p>

<p>In writing this book, the author has treated the
subject from the commonly accepted definition of
the term vegetarianism, which means to abstain from
flesh food, but allows the use of eggs, milk, and its
products. After years of experience in conducting
vegetarian restaurants in several cities and making a
study of the food question, he thinks he can bestow no
greater gift upon the people than to place before them
a book containing instruction in the preparation of
wholesome dishes that will build up in place of tearing
down the body.</p>

<p>In this work I do not claim to have reached perfection,
nor to have exhausted the category of
wholesome preparations and combinations within
the domain of vegetarianism. In our efforts to
teach how to live without the use of flesh foods, we
find we have only begun to discover the inexhaustible
resources of the great vegetable kingdom in the
boundless wealth of varied hygienic foods.</p>

<h3 class="goodcooking">GOOD COOKING</h3>


<p>Good cooking is not the result of accident, a
species of good luck, as it were. There is reason
in every process; a law governing every chemical
change. A course of medical lectures does not make
a physician, nor will a collection of choice recipes
make a cook. There must be a knowledge of compounding,
as well as of compiling; of baking, as well
as of mixing; and above all, one must engage in the
real doing. Theory alone will not suffice; but experience,
which practice only can give, is of the utmost
importance.</p>

<p>Mention will be made under this head of those
forms of cooking only which enter into vegetarian
cooking as usually understood.</p>


<h3>BOILING</h3>

<p>The term "boiling," as applied to cookery, means
cooking in a boiling liquid. Many kinds of food
need the action of water or other liquid, combined
with heat, to cook them in the best manner, and
boiling is one of the most common forms of cookery.
When water becomes too hot to bear the hand
in it with comfort, it has reached one hundred and
fifty degrees, or the scalding point. When there is
a gentle tremor or undulation on the surface, one
hundred and eighty degrees, or the simmering point,
is reached. When there is quite a commotion on the
surface of the water, and the bubbles breaking above
it throw off steam or watery vapor, two hundred and
twelve degrees, or the boiling point, is reached.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
After water reaches the boiling point it becomes no
hotter, no matter how violently it may boil. The
excess of heat escapes in the steam. This important
fact is rarely understood by the average cook, and
much fuel is often needlessly wasted because of the
mistaken idea that rapidly boiling water cooks food
more quickly.</p>

<p>In all ordinary cooking, simmering is more effective
than violent boiling. The temperature of the water
may be slightly raised by covering the kettle. If
sugar or salt or anything to increase its density, is
added to water, it takes longer for it to boil, but its
boiling temperature is higher. This explains why
boiling sugar syrup and boiling salt water are hotter
than boiling fresh water. Boiling effects partial destruction
or removal of organic and mineral impurities
found in water, hence the importance of boiling
the water where such impurities exist. Boiling also
expels all the air and the gases which give fresh
water its sparkle and vitality. Therefore, the
sooner water is used after it begins to boil, the more
satisfactory will be the cooking.</p>

<p>Fresh water should be used when the object is to
extract the flavor, or soluble parts, as in soups and
broths. Salt water should be used when it is desired
to retain the flavor and soluble parts, as in
most green vegetables. Cold water draws out the
starch of vegetables. Boiling water bursts starch
grains, and is absorbed by the swelling starch, and
softens the cellulose in cereals and vegetables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>


<h3>MILK</h3>

<p>In cooking some kinds of food, milk is used instead
of water. Milk being thicker than water, less
of the steam escapes, and it becomes hot sooner
than water, adheres to the pan, and burns easily.
At its boiling temperature (214 degrees), the casein
contained in milk is slightly hardened, and its fat
rendered more difficult of digestion. By heating
milk in a double boiler, these dangers are avoided.
It then only reaches a temperature of 196 degrees,
and is called scalded milk. The process is a form
of steaming.</p>


<h3>STEAMING</h3>

<p>Steaming is a process of cooking food over boiling
water. It is a very satisfactory and convenient
method, without much loss of substance. It takes
a longer time than some other ways of cooking, but
requires less attention. There are two methods of
cooking by steam: (1) In a steamer, which is a
covered pan, with perforated bottom. This is placed
over boiling water, and the steam carries the heat
directly to the food. (2) By means of a double
boiler. By this method the heat is conveyed from
the boiling water, through the inner boiler to the
food. When cooking by steam, the water should
boil steadily until the food is done. Watery vegetables
are made drier by steaming, and flour mixtures
develop a different flavor than when baked.</p>


<h3>STEWING</h3>

<p>Stewing is cooking in a small quantity of water at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a low temperature for a long time, and is a form of
boiling. The food loses less nutriment when stewed
than when rapidly boiled.</p>


<h3>BAKING</h3>

<p>Baking is cooking by means of dry heat, as in a
close oven. The closely-confined heat of the oven
develops flavors which are entirely different from
those obtained by other forms of cooking. The
baking of many kinds of food is as important as the
mixing, and every cook should thoroughly understand
how to regulate the oven. Nearly all flour
mixtures, as bread, cakes, and many kinds of pudding,
are more wholesome when baked than when
cooked in any other way.</p>


<h3>BRAIZING</h3>

<p>Braizing is a combination of stewing and baking.
Meat cooked in a closely-covered stew-pan, so that
it retains its own flavor and those of the vegetables
and flavorings put with it, is braized. Braized
dishes are highly esteemed.</p>


<h3>BROILING</h3>

<p>Broiling, meaning "to burn," is cooking directly
over, or in front of, the clear fire, and is the hottest
form of cooking. The intense heat, combined with
the free action of the air, produces a fine flavor quite
unlike that obtained in any other way. Pan broiling
is broiling on a hot surface instead of over hot
coals.</p>

<h3>SALADS</h3>


<p>All green vegetables that are eaten raw and
dressed with acid, salt, and oil, are included in the
list of salads, and they should always be served crisp
and cool. Wash salad greens carefully, allowing
them to stand in cold or iced water until crisp.
Drain and wipe dry with a soft towel, taking care
not to bruise the leaves, and keep in cool place till
serving time. If they are not thoroughly dried, the
water will collect in the bottom of the dish and ruin
any dressing used.</p>

<p>Pare cucumbers thickly, and remove a thick slice
from each end; cut into thin slices, or into one-half
inch dice, and keep in cold water until ready to serve,
then drain thoroughly; crisp celery in cold water
also.</p>

<p>Pare tomatoes, and keep in a cold place, and
sprinkle with chopped ice at serving time. The list
of vegetables suitable for salads is so long that the
question of kind is wholly a matter of choice. Asparagus,
peas, string beans, beets, cauliflower, etc., are
all well utilized in salads. Freshly cooked vegetables
or left-overs may be used, but all cooked vegetables
must be cold and perfectly tender. By deftly combining
these left-overs with the favorite dressing,
there is material for a delicious and economical
salad, to which the somewhat aristocratic name of
macedoine salad may be given. This salad may consist
of a few or many kinds of vegetables, any combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
pleasing alike to the eye and the palate being
permissible, and if care is taken in the arrangement,
it may be made a very attractive dish.</p>

<p>To the dressing of salads one must give utmost
care and attention, as upon their excellence the success
of the dish principally depends. While rules
for dressings are innumerable, there are, after all,
only a few really good ones. The French dressing
and the mayonnaise are most generally known, the
former being the simplest and most commonly used
of all dressings. And it is quite the favorite for
lettuce, cresses, chicory, and other vegetable salads.
As the salad wilts if allowed to stand in the dressing,
it should not be added till just at the moment
of serving, and it is for this reason that it is frequently
made at the table.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult things to prepare is a
perfect mayonnaise, but once the knack is acquired,
failure afterwards is rare. One essential point is to
have all the materials cold. Chill in the refrigerator
both the bowl and oil an hour or more before using.
In warm weather it is advisable during the mixing
to stand the bowl in a larger one of cracked ice.
This dressing, if covered closely, will keep several
days or longer in the ice-box. Keep in a cold place
till wanted, as it liquefies as soon as mixed with meat
or vegetables. To tone down the taste of the oil,
and thus make more delicate salads, one may add to
the dressing, just before it is used, a little cream
beaten stiff and dry. This dressing is used with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
nut and fruit salads, and may be used with potatoes,
tomatoes, celery, and other vegetables.</p>

<p>Most cooked vegetables intended for salads are
moistened with a French dressing and allowed to
stand an hour or more, or until well seasoned, in a
cold place. To this process the term marinate is
applied. Just before serving, pour off all the marinate
that is not absorbed, and combine with the
mayonnaise. A mistake frequently made in preparing
salad dressing is that of using too much acid.
The acid flavor should not predominate, but other
flavors should also have their value.</p>

<h3>MAYONNAISE DRESSING</h3>


<ul><li>Egg yolk, 1.</li>
<li>Cooking or olive oil.</li>
<li>Lemon juice.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Sugar, 1 tablespoonful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Into a saucer break the yolk of a fresh egg; add
to it a large pinch of salt, and with a fork stir the
yolk till it begins to stiffen. Gradually add to the
yolk, a drop at a time, cooking oil or olive oil, stirring
well after each drop is added. Continue this
process till the mixture becomes too stiff to stir,
then thin it with lemon juice, and add more salt.
The salt helps to stiffen it. Thicken again with oil
in the same manner as before, and thin again with
lemon juice. Continue this till the desired amount
is made. When stiff enough to cut with a knife, add
one tablespoonful of sugar.</p>

<p>This will keep for a number of days, if set on ice.
Success in making this depends upon the care with
which the oil is added; at first, a drop at a time, and
towards the last adding two or three drops, and
perhaps half a teaspoonful at a time.</p>

<p>Note.&mdash;To make it keep well, add one tablespoonful
boiling water, beaten in quickly. To keep from
curdling, put lemon juice and oil on ice for fifteen
minutes before using.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>


<h3>WHITE DRESSING</h3>


<ul><li>Egg yolk, 1, light colored.</li>

<li>Lemon juice, 1 tablespoonful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drop the yolk into a cold bowl, mix lightly, add
a small pinch of salt; then add the oil drop by drop.
The dressing should be very thick. Stand the bowl
in another containing a little cracked ice, so that
you may be constantly reducing the color of the egg.
Now add slowly the lemon juice, then stir in the
whipped cream. This dressing, if properly made,
should be almost as white as whipped cream, while
having the flavor of mayonnaise. Serve with Waldorf
salad.</p>


<h3>BOILED SALAD DRESSING</h3>

egg whisk until thick and light, then add gradually
the melted butter and lemon juice. Cook over hot
water until the mixture thickens and falls away from
the sides of the pan. Take from stove, put into a
glass jar, and when cool cover closely. When ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to use pour into it lightly the rich cream whipped to
a stiff, dry froth. If whipped cream can not conveniently
be obtained, plain sweet or sour cream
may be used in the dressing, but it will not be so
light and flaky.</p>


<h3>CREAM SALAD DRESSING (PLAIN)</h3>

milk or cream on the stove in another saucepan,
and when hot add the beaten eggs. Let cook
smooth, but do not allow it to boil or it will curdle.

<h3>SOUPS</h3>

<p>Cream soups are seasonable at any time, using
any vegetable in its season. Canned goods may be
used when the fresh article is not obtainable.</p>

<p>Vegetables that are too tough and old to cook in
any other way may be used in soups to advantage.
If it can be afforded, a teaspoonful of whipped cream
may be dropped into each plate, and will be found
very delicious.</p>

<p>By a puree is meant a thick soup; it differs but
little from cream soup, being perhaps a trifle thicker.
If properly made, cream soups and purees are dainty,
delicious, and nourishing.</p>

<p>Fruit soups are in favor during hot weather, for
dinners and luncheons; they are very easily made,
and are wholesome and refreshing. Any desired
fruit juice may be thickened with corn starch, sago,
or arrowroot, and served with or without fruit.</p>

<p>Fruit soup should always be served cold, in glass
sherbet cups, with a layer of chipped ice on top.</p>


<h3>KINDS OF SOUP</h3>

<p>Observing these proportions and following the
foregoing directions, delicious cream soups are made
of rice, squash, celery, peas, asparagus, cucumber,
spinach, peanuts, potato, corn, lima beans, cauliflower,
beets, tomato, salsify, chestnut, mushrooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
onions, baked beans, lentils, macaroni, spaghetti,
watercress, string beans, sago, tapioca, barley, carrots,
etc. All vegetables should be cooked very
tender in boiling salted water, drained, and rubbed
through a sieve. Rice, sago, tapioca, and barley
should be boiled slowly till each grain is soft and distinct.
Roasted peanuts are chopped fine; chestnuts
are boiled and mashed; macaroni and spaghetti are
cut into very small pieces, after boiling till tender.
String beans are to be minced before adding to the
soup.</p>


<h3>CREAM SOUPS, FOUNDATION OF</h3>

<p>Rub one heaping tablespoonful of butter and two
of sifted flour to a cream; melt in a saucepan over the
fire, and add slowly four cups milk, stirring constantly.
When it thickens add salt and whatever
seasoning and ingredient is desired to make the soup.</p>

into strips as thin as straws. After all are cut, mix
them lightly together, and to prevent their sticking
together keep them floured a little till you are ready
to drop them into the soup, which should be done
a few minutes before serving. If boiled too long
they go to pieces.</p>

<h3>VEGETABLES</h3>


<p>The term "vegetable," as here used, is applied to
such plants (grains, nuts, and fruits excepted) as are
cultivated and used for food. The use of a large
variety of vegetables in our food assists in promoting
good health. To get the best results, they
should be judiciously combined with nuts, fruits,
and grains. Green vegetables are rich in potash
salts and other minerals necessary to the system,
and in such a form as to be easily assimilated.</p>

<p>Starchy vegetables, as potatoes, supply energy
and heat, and give necessary bulk to the food. Peas,
beans, and lentils contain a large amount of proteid,
used in building and repairing tissue, and are therefore
used in place of meat. For weak stomachs
they are more easily digested in the form of purees
and soups, with the outer indigestible covering removed.
All vegetables should be fresh; for in spite
of all that may be said to the contrary, all vegetables,
whether roots, leaves, or any other kind,
begin to lose bulk and flavor as soon, as removed
from the ground. The kind that suffer least in this
respect are beets, potatoes, carrots, etc. Those
which are most easily affected are cabbage, lettuce,
celery, asparagus, etc.</p>

<p>Vegetables that have been touched with the frost
should be kept in a perfectly dark place for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
days. The frost is then drawn out slowly, and the
vegetables are not so liable to rot.</p>


<h3>GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR VEGETABLES</h3>

<p>Fresh green vegetables should be cooked as soon
after being gathered as possible. Those containing
sugar, as corn and peas, lose some of their sweetness
by standing. Wash thoroughly in cold water, but
unless wilted do not soak. It is better not to prepare
fresh green vegetables until they are needed;
but if they must be prepared some time before cooking,
cover with cold water.</p>

<p>Most vegetables should be put into fresh, rapidly-boiling
water, and if cooked in uncovered vessels,
they will retain a better color, as high heat destroys
their color. In no instance permit them to steep
in the warm water, as this toughens them, and in
some instances destroys both color and flavor.</p>

<p>The salt hardens the water, and also sets the color
in the vegetable. For peas and beans do not add
salt to the water until they are nearly done, as they
do not boil tender so readily in hard water.</p>

<p>Corn should not be boiled in salt water, as the
salt hardens the outer covering of skin and makes
it tough. Cook the vegetables rapidly till perfectly
tender, but no longer. If vegetables are
cooked too long, flavor, color, and appearance are
all impaired. To judge when done, watch carefully,
and test by piercing with a fork. The time required
to cook a vegetable varies with its age and freshness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
therefore, the time tables given for cooking serve
only as approximate guides.</p>

<p>Delicate vegetables, as green peas, shelled beans,
celery, etc., should be cooked in as little water as
possible, toward the last the water being allowed to
boil away till there is just enough left to moisten.
In this manner all the desirable soluble matter that
may have been drawn out in cooking is saved.</p>

<p>Strongly flavored vegetables, as cabbage, onions,
etc., should be cooked in a generous quantity of
water, and the water in which onions are cooked
may be changed one or more times.</p>

<p>The general rule for seasoning vegetables is as
<span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>To two cups small whole vegetables, or two cups
of vegetables mashed or sliced, add a rounding teaspoonful
of butter, and half a level teaspoonful of
salt. To beans, peas, and squash, add one-half
teaspoonful of sugar to improve them. Add milk
or the vegetable liquid when additional moisture is
required.</p>


<h3>POTATOES</h3>

<p>Pre-eminent among vegetables stands the potato.</p>

<p>The solid matter of potatoes consists largely of
starch, with a small quantity of albumen and mineral
salts. Potatoes also contain an acid juice, the
greater portion of which lies near the skin. This
bitter principle is set free by heat. While potatoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
are being boiled, it passes into the water; in baking
it escapes with the steam.</p>

<p>New potatoes may be compared to unripe fruit,
as the starch grains are not fully matured. Potatoes
are at their best in the fall, and they keep well
during the winter. In the spring, when germination
commences, the starch changes to dextrin or
gum, rendering the potato more waxy when cooked,
and the sugar then formed makes them sweeter.
When the potatoes are frozen, the same change
takes place.</p>

<p>In the spring, when potatoes are shriveled and
gummy, soaking improves them, as the water thus
absorbed dissolves the gum, and makes them less
sticky. At other times, long soaking is undesirable.</p>

<p>Soak about half an hour in the fall, one to three
hours in winter and spring. Never serve potatoes,
whether boiled or baked, in a closely covered dish,
as they thus become sodden and clammy; but cover
with a folded napkin, and allow the moisture to
escape. They require about forty-five minutes to
one hour to bake, if of a good size, and should be
served promptly when done.</p>


<h3>BAKED POTATOES</h3>

<p>Potatoes are either baked in their jackets or
peeled; in either case they should not be exposed to
a fierce heat, inasmuch as thereby a great deal of the
vegetable is scorched and rendered uneatable. They
should be frequently turned while being baked, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
kept from touching one another in the oven or dish.
When they are pared, they should be baked in a dish,
and oil of some kind added, to prevent their outsides
from becoming burned.</p>


<h3>MASHED POTATOES</h3>

<p>Pare and boil or steam six or eight large potatoes.
If boiled, drain when tender, and let set in the kettle
for a few minutes, keeping them covered, shaking
the kettle occasionally to prevent scorching. Mash
with a wire potato masher, or, if convenient, press
through a colander; add salt, a lump of butter, and
sufficient hot milk to moisten thoroughly. Whip
with the batter whip, or wooden spoon, until light
and fluffy. Heap up on a plate, press a lump of
butter into the top, and send to the table hot.</p>


<h3>POTATO PUFFS</h3>


<ul><li>Potatoes, prepared as for mashed potatoes, 2 cups.</li>
<li>Cream or milk, &frac34; cup.</li>
<li>Melted butter, 2 tablespoonfuls.</li>

<li>Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix and beat up thoroughly, folding in the beaten
whites last. Make into balls, put into greased pans,
brush with beaten egg, and bake a light brown.</p>


<h3>MINCED POTATOES</h3>

<p>Mince six large, cold potatoes. Put them in a
baking-pan, cover with milk; add a little cream, and
bake fifteen minutes.</p>

<li>Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut potatoes into even slices, put in a baking-pan,
sprinkle with a little salt, and a few small pieces
of butter. Pour over the milk and flour mixture,
and sprinkle the top with a layer of crumbs. Cover
and bake till potatoes are tender. Remove the
cover and brown lightly.</p>


<h3>SCALLOPED POTATOES NO. 2</h3>


<ul><li>Cold, boiled potatoes, sliced.</li>
<li>Thin cream sauce.</li>
</ul>

<p>Place in alternate layers in a pan and sprinkle the
top with ground bread crumbs. Bake until brown.</p>


<h3>HASHED BROWNED POTATOES</h3>

<p>Use cold, boiled potatoes or good left-over baked
potatoes. Pare and cut into three-quarter-inch dice
or irregular pieces. Put in a shallow baking-pan,
sprinkle with salt, pour over sufficient cooking oil,
season well, and prevent scorching. Put into the
oven, and when they begin to brown, stir continually
till all are nicely browned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>


<h3>NEW POTATOES AND CREAM</h3>

<li>Cream.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Butter.</li>
<li>Parsley.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash and rub new potatoes with a coarse cloth
or scrubbing brush; drop into boiling water and boil
briskly till done, but no more. Press the potato
against the side of the kettle with a fork; if done, it
will yield to gentle pressure. In a saucepan have
ready some butter and cream, hot but not boiling,
a little green parsley, and salt. Drain the potatoes,
add the mixture, put over hot water a minute or
two, and serve.</p>

parsley. Shake over the fire until the potatoes are
heated through. Pour into a deep dish and serve.</p>


<h3>POTATOES A LA DELMONICO</h3>

<p>Cut the potatoes with a vegetable cutter into
small balls about the size of marbles. Put them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
into stew-pan with plenty of butter and a good
sprinkling of salt. Keep the saucepan covered and
shake occasionally until they are quite done, which

<li>Rich cream sauce.</li>
<li>Sifted bread crumbs.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash, scrape, cut in thin slices, and put into
plenty of cold water till ready to use, to prevent
discoloration. When ready to cook, boil in enough
water to prevent scorching. Salt when they begin
to get tender. Boil a few minutes longer, but do
not let them get too salty. Drain, or remove with a
skimmer, putting a layer in a baking-pan, then a
little rich cream sauce, then another layer of each.
Sprinkle the top with sifted bread crumbs, and bake
a light brown.</p>


<h3>MOCK OYSTERS</h3>


<ul><li>Corn, young and tender, 6 ears.</li>
<li>Flour, 3 tablespoonfuls.</li>
<li>Butter, 3 tablespoonfuls.</li>
<li>Eggs, 3.</li>
<li>Oil.</li>
<li>Salt, 3 teaspoonfuls.</li>
</ul>

<p>Grate the corn with a coarse grater into a deep
dish; beat the whites and yolks separately, and add
the corn, flour, butter, and salt. Drop spoonfuls of
this batter into a frying-pan with hot oil, and fry a
light brown on both sides. The corn must be
young.</p>


<h3>CELERY</h3>

<p>Cut off all the roots and remove all the decayed and
outside leaves. Wash thoroughly, being careful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
remove all specks and blemishes. If the stalks are
large, divide them lengthwise into two or three
pieces and place root downward in a celery glass,
which should be nearly filled with cold water.</p>


<h3>STEWED CELERY</h3>


<ul><li>Celery hearts, 6.</li>
<li>White sauce, 2 cups.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the celery into half-inch lengths and cook in
boiling, salted water. When tender, drain and pour
over this the sauce. Heat well, and serve. The liquid
drained from the celery may be thickened, seasoned
with a little butter, and used instead of the white
sauce if preferred.</p>


<h3>LENTILS (ORIENTAL STYLE)</h3>


<ul><li>Lentils, 1 cup.</li>
<li>Olive oil, 2 tablespoonfuls.</li>
<li>Salt, 1 level teaspoonful.</li>
<li>Boiled rice, 1 cup.</li>
<li>Onion, finely shredded, 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the lentils well, soak overnight, and drain.
Cook in boiling water till tender; drain again. Put
the olive oil in a saucepan, add the onion, and cook
till the onion is soft, not brown. Add the lentils
and boiled rice, mix, stir over the fire till hot, add
the salt, and serve hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<h3>LENTILS WITH ONIONS</h3>


<ul><li>Lentils, 1 cup.</li>
<li>Onions, 2.</li>
<li>Butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash the lentils, put to cook in saucepan with
plenty of cold water, and boil till tender; when soft,
turn them into a fine colander, and drain thoroughly,
saving the water they were cooked in. Peel the
onions, cut into thin slices, put in a flat stew-pan with
a lump of butter, or a little olive oil, and fry. Put
the lentils in the onions and add salt to taste.
Moisten with a little of the broth drained from the
lentils and allow them to simmer at the side of the
fire. Serve.</p>


<h3>CREAMED CHESTNUTS</h3>

<p>Boil or steam the chestnuts till tender. Make a
cream sauce of milk or cream, seasoned with butter,
and slightly thickened with flour. Pour this over the
chestnuts; serve as a vegetable.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS NO. 1</h3>

<p>Asparagus, like potatoes, contains a bitter alkaloid,
which is drawn into the water in cooking, and
often imparts to it a very unpleasant flavor. This
may be remedied by blanching the asparagus in boiling
water for four or five minutes. Then drain, and
add more hot water, and finish cooking.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS NO. 2</h3>

<p>Scrape the stalk ends of the asparagus or break
off the tough lower stalks as far as they will snap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Wash well, tie in bundles, and put into enough
rapidly-boiling salted water to cover. Allow a teaspoonful
of salt to each quart of water; cook uncovered
from twenty to thirty minutes, or till perfectly
tender. Drain, remove the string, spread with
salt and butter, and serve immediately on toast. The
asparagus may be neatly arranged on hot toast and
covered with white cream sauce, if preferred.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS POMPADOUR</h3>

<p>Wash the asparagus carefully, place in a saucepan
of boiling salted water, and boil till done. Take
them out and cut into lengths of about two inches,
and place on a cloth near the fire to dry. Prepare
a little sauce made of lemon juice, butter, yolk of
an egg, and salt. Place the asparagus on a dish,
over which pour the sauce, and serve.</p>


<h3>PEAS</h3>

<p>The flavor of peas and the time required for cooking
depend largely upon their freshness. Very
young peas will cook tender in twenty minutes, older
peas sometimes requiring an hour or more. A teaspoonful
of finely minced parsley cooked with peas
imparts to them a very delicious flavor.</p>


<h3>STEWED ASPARAGUS</h3>

<p>Break the tender parts of the asparagus into one-inch
lengths and put into enough boiling water to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
cover. Boil till tender; add sufficient rich milk or
cream to make a gravy. Thicken with flour, season
with salt, let come to a boil, and serve.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS WITH EGGS</h3>


<ul><li>Asparagus.</li>
<li>Cream, 2 tablespoonfuls.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Eggs, 4.</li>
<li>Butter, 1 tablespoonful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut the tender tops from a bunch of asparagus,
and boil about twenty minutes. Then put into a
baking-tin with butter and salt. Beat the whites
and yolks of the eggs separately, add the cream and
pour this over the asparagus. Bake until the eggs
are set.</p>


<h3>ASPARAGUS WITH GREEN PEAS</h3>


<ul><li>Asparagus, 2 cups.</li>
<li>Peas, 2 cups.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Rich milk or cream.</li>
<li>Flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Break the tender parts of the asparagus into one-inch
lengths and put with the peas into boiling
water enough to cover. Boil till tender; add sufficient
rich milk or cream to make a gravy. Thicken
with flour, season with salt, let come to a boil, and
serve.</p>


<h3>BAKED BEANS</h3>

<p>Wash one and three-fourths cups of navy beans
and put them into an earthen jar, covering immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
with one and three-fourths quarts of boiling
water. Add salt, cover, and put into the oven.
When they boil well, draw the jar to the edge of
the oven, where they will just simmer. Cook for
twenty-four hours. If they get too dry, add a little
boiling water. The beans will be nicely colored and
have a rich flavor.</p>


<h3>BAKED BEANS</h3>


<ul><li>Small white beans, 2 cups.</li>
<li>Protose, if desired.</li>
<li>Molasses, 1 teaspoonful.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clean the beans, soak in cold water one hour,
season with salt and molasses. Put into a covered
jar with plenty of water; bake overnight in a slow
oven. When done, the beans should be whole, dry,
and mealy, and of a rich brown color. This can
only be obtained by baking the beans several hours
in a slow oven. If desired, a little chopped protose
may be added. Serve the beans plain, or with brown
bread.</p>


<h3>PUREE OF BEANS</h3>

<p>Follow the directions given for puree of peas.</p>


<h3>BEANS STEWED</h3>

<p>Wash the required quantity of navy, lima, kidney,
or other beans, and put to cook in plenty of boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
water; boil till they are swollen, then put them where
they will stew till cooked; season just before they
finish cooking. Never parboil beans.</p>


<h3>BAKED BEANS WITH TOMATO SAUCE</h3>

<p>Prepare the beans as for plain baked beans; put
into the jars to bake; cover with a mixture of
strained stewed tomatoes and water in equal proportions;
a little butter or olive oil may be added.</p>


<h3>SUCCOTASH</h3>


<ul><li>Fresh shelled lima beans, 2 cups.</li>
<li>Sweet corn, 2 ears.</li>
<li>Cream, &frac12; cup.</li>
<li>Butter, size of an egg.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put beans in pot with cold water, rather more than
will cover them. Scrape the kernels from twelve
ears of young sweet corn. Put the cobs in with the
peas, boiling from thirty to forty-five minutes.
Take out the cobs and put in the scraped corn.
Boil again for fifteen minutes; then season with salt,
butter and cream. Serve hot.</p>


<h3>ONIONS</h3>

<p>Contrary to the opinion of many, the onion is not
objectionable as an article of food. Judiciously
used it fills as important a place in cooking as salt
or any other seasoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<h3>BAKED ONIONS</h3>


<ul><li>Onions, large, 6.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Crumbs.</li>
<li>Milk.</li>
<li>Butter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put onions into a saucepan of water, or water
and milk mixed in equal proportions; add salt and
boil till tender. When done so that they can be
easily mashed, work them up with a little butter into
a paste. Cover with bread crumbs and bake in a
moderate oven.</p>


<h3>STUFFED ONIONS</h3>

<p>Peel the desired number of onions, being careful
not to cut off the root end. Take out the inside
of the onion and fill the hole with a mixture of
bread crumbs, beaten egg, and a little milk. Season
with salt and sage. Bake in oven until brown.</p>


<h3>SCRAMBLED TOMATOES</h3>


<ul><li>Tomatoes, 6.</li>
<li>Eggs, 3.</li>
<li>Butter.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remove the skins from six tomatoes and cut them
up in a saucepan. Add a little butter and salt.
When sufficiently boiled beat up eggs, and just before
you serve turn them into the saucepan with the
tomatoes, and stir one way for two minutes, allowing
them time to get thoroughly done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<h3>SPINACH</h3>

<p>Trim the spinach and wash in three or four waters
to remove the grit. Cook in boiling water about
twenty minutes, removing the scum. Do not cover
the vessel while cooking. When tender, turn into
a colander, drain, and press well. Chop fine, put
into a saucepan with butter and salt. Set on the fire
and cook till quite dry, stirring it all the time. Turn
into a vegetable dish, shape, and garnish with slices
of hard-boiled eggs.</p>


<h3>SUMMER SQUASH</h3>

<p>Wash and cut in pieces. Cook in the steamer,
that it may be as dry as possible. When done, let
it stand and drain a few minutes, shaking it occasionally.
Mash and season with salt, butter, and a little
cream.</p>


<h3>WINTER SQUASH (HUBBARD)</h3>

<p class="cont"><i>Mashed</i>:</p>

<p>Cut the squash, pare, remove seeds, wash, and
put into the steamer. Cook until soft, remove and
mash or press through a colander. Season with
salt, butter, sugar, and a little sweet cream. Beat
well, and serve.</p>

<p class="cont"><i>Baked</i>:</p>

<p>Cut into pieces of desired size, remove seeds,
sprinkle with a little sugar and salt; bake until done.
Serve in the shell, or it may be peeled before baking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>


<h3>PUREE OF PEAS</h3>


<ul><li>Peas, fresh, 2 cups (or dry, 1 cup).</li>
<li>Butter, 1 tablespoonful.</li>
<li>Cream or milk, 1&frac12; cups.</li>
<li>Flour, 1 level tablespoonful.</li>
<li>Salt, 1 teaspoonful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the peas to cook in boiling water; boil until
tender, then simmer slowly, cooking as dry as possible
without scorching. When soft and dry, rub
through a colander to remove the hulls. Put the
butter in a saucepan; when melted stir in the flour,
being careful not to scorch; pour in the milk gradually,
stirring all the time; and when thoroughly
cooked, add the salt and the pulp of the peas. Turn
all into a double boiler, heat thoroughly, and serve.</p>


<h3>GREEN CORN (STEWED)</h3>


<ul><li>Green corn, 3 cups.</li>
<li>Butter.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Milk, more or less, 1 cup.</li>
<li>Sugar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Husk and clean as for boiling corn; with a sharp
knife cut off the top of the grain, being careful not
to cut too close to the cob and with the back of the
knife press out the remaining pulp. When cut in
this way, the corn is much more juicy than when the

and corn; cook from ten to fifteen minutes, or until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
it loses its raw taste. Stir frequently, and season
to taste with salt and sugar.</p>


<h3>GREEN CORN (BOILED)</h3>

<p>Strip off the husk, remove the silk, put into fresh
boiling water, and cook ten to twenty minutes.
Cook only till done, for if boiled too long, the corn
hardens, and its flavor is impaired. If the corn is
not very sweet, add one-fourth cup of sugar to the
water in which it is boiled.</p>

<p>Shell the peas and cover with cold water; skim off
undeveloped peas which rise to the top of the water
and drain. Barely cover with boiling water; cook

water should remain. Season to taste with butter
and add more salt if needed. A little sugar is sometimes
an improvement.</p>

<p>When the peas are older, half a cup of milk or
cream, with sufficient flour to thicken, is considered
an improvement.</p>

<h3>CARAMEL-CEREAL<br />
(A Substitute for Coffee)</h3>

<p>For each cup of the beverage required use two
tablespoonfuls of the cereal and boil for ten to
twenty minutes. Then remove to the side of the
range and let steep a few minutes. The strength and
aroma of cereal coffee are developed by long
steeping.</p>


<h3>CHOCOLATE<br />
(Sanitas)</h3>

<p>Grate some Sanitas chocolate, place in a saucepan,
and to each two ounces allow one cup of cold
water. Let it stand until the chocolate is soft, place

Work it briskly with an egg beater, then serve at
once, adding at the last moment a tablespoonful of
whipped cream to each cup.</p>

<p>It is considered an improvement by some to use
two-thirds chocolate and one-third malted nuts.</p>

<p>Other chocolate is not recommended, as it contains
an injurious alkaloid, which in the Sanitas
brand is removed by a special process.</p>


<h3>FRUIT NECTAR</h3>

Into the juice of twelve lemons grate the rind of
six. Be careful to exclude all seeds and the inner
white skin, as they impart a bitter taste. Let stand
overnight. Make thick syrup of white sugar, and

<h3>CEREALS</h3>

<p>Grains may be considered perfect food in themselves,
as they contain all the food elements in
nearly right proportions. Rice is an exception to
this, the starch being in excess.</p>

<p>In cooking grains in the form of porridges, they
should be introduced into rapidly salted water,
beating with a batter whisk so that the grains may
be thoroughly mixed with the water and be free
from lumps. In cooking coarse grains, as cracked
wheat, pearl barley, hominy, etc., keep them boiling,
stirring occasionally until the grain does not sink
to the bottom, but hangs suspended in the water.
If the inner part of a double boiler has been used,
it may now be set into the outer boiler, which should
be placed on the range where the water will boil
rapidly. Replenish the water in the outside boiler
from time to time with boiling water.</p>

<p>By setting the grain in boiling water, the indigestible
outer portion or cellulose is more completely
broken up, and the starch granules are more
thoroughly acted upon by the water, the object being
to cook the starch and the gluten as thoroughly
as possible. If the grains are cooked in a double
boiler, they will not need to be stirred after they are
set, except when cooked in a very large quantity.
The cooking should be continuous and the length
of time varies according to the varying proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of gluten in the grain. The larger percentage of
starch, the shorter the time required in cooking.
Grains combine nicely with fruits, and may be
cooked or served with either fruit or fruit juices.</p>


<h3>OATMEAL</h3>


<ul><li>Oatmeal, 1 cup.</li>
<li>Water, 1 quart.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put water into a double boiler, place on the range,
and when boiling add oatmeal. Boil until it thickens
and finish in double boiler. Cook five hours.</p>


<h3>ROLLED OATS</h3>


<ul><li>Rolled oats, 1&frac12; cups.</li>
<li>Water, 1 quart.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put water into a double boiler, place on the range,
and when boiling add rolled oats. Boil until it
thickens and finish in double boiler. Cook four
hours.</p>

<li>Salt, 1 teaspoonful.</li>
<li>Cracked wheat, 1 cup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put water into the inner double boiler, place on
the range, and when boiling add salt and cracked
wheat. Boil rapidly until grains do not sink when
the dish is lifted from the range. Place in the outer
boiler and cook constantly for four or five hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

</ul>

<p>Put the milk or water in the inner part of a double
boiler, place on the range, and when boiling add salt
and farina. Let it boil for two or three minutes,
stirring all the time. Then place in a double boiler
and cook one hour. If milk is used, it should first
be simmered or scalded in a double boiler, and then
placed on the range and the milk will boil almost
immediately. In this way the milk will not be so
liable to scorch as if it was put on the range at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
first. This rule will apply to all grains cooked with
milk.</p>

<h3>TOASTS</h3>

<p>Toasts are uniformly and properly regarded as a
breakfast dish, and when properly prepared are
wholesome, nutritious, and appetizing, and far more
conducive to health than the fried mushes and
griddle cakes with which so many are prone to
appease their appetites.</p>

<p>Zwieback should be used as the foundation of all
toasts, although ordinary toasted bread can be used.
In toasting bread, do not expose it to such fierce
heat that the bread will be burned or singed.
Singed bread is not toasted bread. Again, the fire
should be hot enough to more than simply dry the
bread. It should be toasted as far through as possible,
and should be crisp and brittle, not hard. In
using zwieback for toast it may be moistened by hot
milk, if for cream, gravy, or egg toast; or with hot
salted water, if for fruit. In either case the toast
should be dipped quickly in and out again so as not
to absorb too much liquid and become mushy.
Under this head a few kinds of toasts will be given,
inexpensive and otherwise. While it is not an exhaustive
list, it will include sufficient to suggest
others equally good.</p>

<h3>NUTTOLENE ON TOAST</h3>

<p>Mince half a pound of nuttolene very fine, put in
a well-oiled saucepan, and fry over the fire till a
delicate brown. Great care must be taken to prevent
scorching; shake the pan often. Make two
cups of rich cream sauce well seasoned with butter
sauce, and desiccated cocoanut. Strain this over
the nuttolene, and serve a spoonful on warm toast.
This makes six large portions.</p>


<h3>BERRY TOAST</h3>

<p>Any canned fruit, as strawberries, blackberries,

asparagus on it, pour a spoonful of white sauce on
the bottom end of the stalks, and serve.</p>


<h3>APPLE TOAST</h3>

<p>Fresh stewed apples, rubbed through a colander
and sweetened, make a nice dressing. The apples
may be flavored with lemon, or mixed with grape or
cranberry sauce. When the apples are put in the
colander, the liquid may be poured into a saucepan
and boiled into a syrup, and the toast moistened
with this. Serve a spoonful or two of the apple
sauce over all.</p>


<h3>APRICOT TOAST</h3>

<p>In making apricot marmalade, save the juice by
itself and boil it down into a syrup. Moisten the

<h3>BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES</h3>

<p>Thin batters are about the consistency of thin
cream. Thick batters are like cream. Still thicker
batters, which may be poured in a continuous stream,
are called pour batters. Any batter is a pour batter
until it is made so stiff that it breaks or drops in the
pouring, when it is called a drop batter. It will remain
a batter until too stiff to be beaten, when it
becomes a dough.</p>

<p>Doughs, like batters, are of varying degrees of
thickness, ranging from those just stiff enough to
be handled to those which may be rolled thin as
paper. Generally speaking, one full measure of flour
to one scant measure of liquid makes a pour batter.
Two full measures of flour make a drop batter; and
three full measures make a dough; although, for
various reasons, these proportions are subject to
many modifications.</p>

<p>If the ingredients in batters were simply mixed
and cooked slowly, the resulting substances would
be hard and compact, unfit for human digestion.
Hence, to obviate this, and to make them light and
porous, we must resort to other processes. This
is accomplished by means of the expansion of incorporated
air, by the generation of gas within the
mixture, or by a combination of both methods, supplemented
by quick cooking before the gas has a
chance to escape.</p>

<p>Air at seventy degrees expands to about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
times its volume when exposed to the temperature
of a hot oven. Consequently, as a mixture heats
in cooking, incorporated air expands, giving the
desired lightness. Air is incorporated or enclosed
in batters by beating the mixture thoroughly, as in
making whole-wheat gems; by adding eggs to the
beaten mixture, as in popovers; and by the gas
obtained by the union of an acid with an alkaline
carbonate, as in the use of baking powders. In batters
made light by the admixture of air, one must
exercise care in beating to actually incorporate and
retain the air. When eggs are added to the mixture,
the glutinous consistency of the albumin they
contain assists in retaining the entangled air.</p>


<h3>GEMS OR PUFFS (PLAIN)</h3>


<ul><li>Milk, 1 cup.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Cooking oil, 1 tablespoonful, if desired.</li>
<li>Egg, 1.</li>
<li>Sifted flour, about 2 cups.</li>
</ul>

<p>Break the egg into the milk, add salt, and beat
thoroughly. Beat into this enough sifted flour to
make a batter that will pile slightly when poured in
a thick stream. Bake in hot greased gem irons in
a brisk oven. A tablespoonful of cooking oil may
be added to the milk if a richer batter is desired.</p>


<h3>CORN GEMS</h3>

<p>Make same as plain gems, but use one-fourth corn
meal and a little sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>


<h3>WHOLE-WHEAT AND GRAHAM GEMS</h3>

<p>Use one-fourth to one-third whole wheat or
graham flour.</p>


<h3>GRANOSE PUFFS</h3>


<ul><li>Eggs, 4.</li>
<li>Ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Sugar, &frac14; cup.</li>
<li>Granose flakes, 4 cups.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat the yolks of the eggs with the sugar until
light, then add the cinnamon and salt. Beat again,
then add two cups granose flakes. Mix thoroughly
and add half of the stiffly-beaten whitest of the eggs,
then two more cups granose flakes, and lastly the
rest of the whites. Drop in round gem irons, filling
them heaping full, and bake a light brown. They
may be iced and a little shredded cocoanut sprinkled
on top.</p>


<h3>VEGETARIAN HOT CAKES</h3>


<ul><li>Bread crumbs, 4 cups.</li>
<li>Flour, 1 cup.</li>
<li>Salt, 1 teaspoonful.</li>

<p>Mix all together thoroughly, and add sufficient</p>


<ul><li>Milk heated at 140&deg; or 150&deg;,</li>
</ul>

<p>To make a thick pour batter. To this add the</p>


<ul><li>Yolks of 5 eggs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat up thoroughly and add the</p>


<ul><li>Stiffly-beaten whites.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bake on soapstone griddle. Be careful not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
have the milk scalding hot, as it renders cakes soft
and sticky.</p>


<h3>GREEN CORN GRIDDLE CAKES</h3>


<ul><li>Corn, 1 quart, cut from the ear.</li>
<li>Butter, 2 tablespoonfuls.</li>
<li>White corn meal, 3 tablespoonfuls.</li>
<li>Salt, &frac14; teaspoonful.</li>
<li>Milk, 1 cup.</li>
<li>Eggs, 4.</li>
<li>Flour, &frac12; cup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix thoroughly and bake on soapstone griddle.</p>


<h3>BAKED CORN PIE</h3>

<li>Milk, 2 cups.</li>
<li>Salt, 1 teaspoonful.</li>
<li>Butter, 2 tablespoonfuls.</li>
<li>Eggs, 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Warm the butter and stir through the corn; beat
the eggs with the milk, add the salt, and mix with
the butter and the corn. Turn into a pan and bake
until set. Should be light brown.</p>


<h3>POPOVERS</h3>


<ul><li>Flour, 2 cups.</li>
<li>Milk, 1&frac34; cups.</li>
<li>Butter.</li>

</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix the salt and flour, pour on slowly half the
milk to make a smooth batter; add the eggs, one at
a time, beating well, and gradually the remaining
milk. Beat vigorously for a few minutes, then turn
at once into hot well-buttered gem-pans, filling them
about half full. Bake in rather hot oven from
twenty to thirty minutes.</p>


<h3>CORN BREAD WITHOUT BAKING POWDER NO. 1</h3>


<ul><li>Corn meal, 2 cups.</li>
<li>Eggs, 4.</li>
<li>Salt.</li>
<li>Boiling milk, 3 cups.</li>
<li>Butter, size of egg.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the meal into the mixing bowl, make hollow
in the center, put in butter and salt, and pour the
hot milk over all, and stir well. Let cool, and if too
stiff, add a little more cold milk. Break the eggs
and separate them; add the yolks to the meal and
beat five minutes. Beat the whites and add them
to the batter. Oil a baking-pan, make it hot, and
turn in the batter. Bake in a quick oven thirty
minutes.</p>


<h3>HOE CAKE</h3>


<ul><li>Corn meal, 4 cups.</li>
<li>Water, or milk.</li>
<li>Melted butter, 1 tablespoonful.</li>
<li>Salt and sugar as desired.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Sift corn meal with a little salt, and sugar if desired;
scald with sufficient water or milk to make a
stiff batter, but soft enough to spread easily with a
knife. A tablespoonful of melted butter may be
added if desired. Spread on a baking-sheet or pan
about one-half inch thick or less and bake slowly
till crisp clear through.</p>

<p>If the cake bakes fast on the bottom, it may be
turned over so that both sides may be evenly baked.</p>


<h3>CORN BREAD WITHOUT BAKING POWDER NO. 2</h3>


<ul><li>Corn meal, 2 cups.</li>
<li>Flour, 1 cup.</li>
<li>Salt, 1 teaspoonful.</li>
<li>Sugar, &frac14; cup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix and add</p>


<ul><li>Boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p>sufficient to make stiff dough; let cool, then stir in</p>


<ul><li>Butter, 1 tablespoonful.</li>
<li>Beaten yolks, 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>and lastly the</p>


<ul><li>Stiffly-beaten whites, 6.</li>
</ul>


<h3>CORN BREAD NO. 3</h3>


<ul><li>Sponge, 3 cups.</li>
<li>Butter, 1 rounded tablespoonful.</li>
<li>Mixture, 2 parts corn meal to 1 part flour.</li>

<li>Sugar, 3 heaped tablespoonfuls.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Take three cups of the sponge as set for making
wheat bread, measured when light, ready to mix up
stiff. Add sugar, eggs, and butter. To this add a
mixture of two-thirds corn meal and one-third flour
until it is as stiff as will stir conveniently (if made
too stiff, the bread will be dry; if not stiff enough,
it will be sticky). Put about half an inch deep in
greased pans, and let rise till nearly an inch deep
and bake in a moderate oven. It may be in deeper
loaves, but they are not likely to be so satisfactory.</p>


<h3>GEORGIA PONES</h3>


<ul><li>Southern corn meal, 2 cups.</li>
<li>Sugar, 1 tablespoonful.</li>
<li>Salt, &frac12; teaspoonful.</li>
<li>Boiling milk or cream.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sift meal with sugar and salt. Pour over this
enough boiling milk or cream to make a stiff drop
batter. Stir constantly, that the meal may not
lump. When perfectly smooth, drop in large spoonfuls
on a cold buttered baking-sheet and bake in a
brisk oven. The pones should be browned on top.</p>

<p>Put the milk into double boiler; when scalding
hot, set the inner boiler on range until the milk
boils; then stir in the farina, sugar, and salt. Let
boil till the farina is set, then set back in outer
boiler and cook one hour. Turn into molds previously
oiled or dipped into cold water. May be
served with cream sweetened and flavored, or with
fruit juice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

</ul>

<p>Warm the cream to about seventy degrees, add
the salt, yeast, and about two cups of the flour.
Mix thoroughly, cover, and set in a warm place to
rise. When well risen and lively, add the rest of
the flour, and leave until perfectly smooth. Roll
out about half an inch thick. Put in greased pans,
brush the top with melted butter, let rise until about
double its original size, and bake. Split, and fill
with whole or crushed berries, sprinkled with sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>


<h3>STRAWBERRY GRANOSE</h3>

<li>Sugar, &frac12; cup.</li>
<li>Eggs, 5.</li>
<li>Jelly, 2 tablespoonfuls.</li>
<li>Flavor to suit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make a custard with the milk, the yolks of the
eggs, the whites of two, and the sugar. Whip the
remaining three whites to a stiff froth with a little
sugar and flavoring, same as custard. Pour the
custard into individual glass dishes, drop spoonfuls
of the whites on the custard so as to form islands,
or it may be put on with a pastry tube or paper funnel.
Drop a little bright jelly in the center of each
island.</p>


<h3>CORN STARCH BLANC MANGE</h3>


<ul><li>Milk, 1 quart.</li>
<li>Corn starch, 4 heaped tablespoonfuls.</li>

the fire. When scalding hot, add the remaining
milk in which has been dissolved the sugar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
corn starch. Stir till it is thick and there are no
lumps. Flavor with lemon, take from the range,
and add the stiffly beaten whites. Pour into molds
and set in a cool place to get firm.</p>

<p>A pleasing effect may be obtained by dividing the
mixture after it is cooked, and coloring one-half
pink, then filling the mold one-third of one, and filling
up with the other. When turned from the mold
they will look like small, white pyramids capped
with pink, or pink with white. A custard to be
served with this blanc mange is made of two cups
of milk, the yolks of three eggs, and half a cup of
sugar. Flavor same as blanc mange.</p>

thin. Put a layer of the pineapple in a deep pan;
pour over some of the tapioca, then another layer of
pineapple, and so on till all the pineapple and tapioca
are used. Serve cold.</p>


<h3>BANANA TAPIOCA</h3>

<p>Same as pineapple tapioca, but use bananas instead
of pineapples. Milk may be substituted for
water, and two eggs used if desired.</p>

<p>The tapioca may be flavored and colored if desired.</p>


<h3>DATES STUFFED WITH MALTED NUTS</h3>

<p>Wash, dry, and pit the desired quantity of dates,
being careful not to break more than are necessary.
Fill the cavity made by removing the pit with malted
nuts, and press together. Make an icing of the
white of an egg, eight or nine tablespoonfuls of
powdered sugar, a few drops of lemon juice, and one
teaspoonful of corn starch. Dip the dates in this,
using a sharp toothpick with which to handle them,
and place on an oiled paper or plate to dry. Or the
icing may be made with less sugar, and after they
are dipped, roll them in powdered or Victor sugar.</p>

a teacup of brown sugar; sift a teaspoonful of flour
over, a pinch of salt, and a little grated nutmeg.
Cover with the top crust, pressing down the edges
tightly. Trim and bake in a good oven forty-five
minutes. This pie is the typical berry pie.</p>

<h3>NUT BUTTER</h3>

<p>Nut butter can be easily made in the home, but
nearly all the prepared nut foods on sale require expensive
machinery and a steam plant to produce,
hence can not be made in the home.</p>

<p>Peanuts and almonds are the nuts most suitable
for making nut butter. The other varieties are difficult
to blanch and do not make good butter. The
best variety of peanuts for making nut butter is the
Spanish shelled. They are the most easily blanched.
Removing the skins from the nuts after they are
shelled is called blanching. Peanuts can not be
blanched unless they have been thoroughly heated.</p>

<p>To properly cook peanuts is the essential thing
to produce a healthful, palatable nut butter. This
can be accomplished if care is exercised. There are
three ways of cooking them: namely, baking or roasting,
boiling, and steaming. The baking process is the
easiest way, but care should be used not to scorch
them. Scorched or burnt peanuts are unfit to use
in any form.</p>


<h3>PROCESS NO. 1</h3>

<p>Put a layer of peanuts about one-half inch deep
in a dripping-pan and place on perforated shelf in
a moderate oven. Allow them to bake slowly for
about one hour. Cook them until they are a light
brown or straw color. Shake the pan or stir the
peanuts every few minutes. When the kernels begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to crack and pop they brown very quickly and
should be watched closely.</p>

<p>A splendid way to cook them is to fill a tight-covered
dish about two-thirds full, place in the oven,
and shake occasionally. When cooked this way,
they are not so liable to burn, and they retain their
flavor better. When they have cooked sufficiently,
spread out at once. When they have become quite
cool, blanch as follows: This can be done by rubbing
them in the hands, or what is better, a coarse bag, or
take a piece of cloth and fold the ends together, forming
a bag. Another good device is a screen made of
coarse wire. Rub them until the skins are loose.
The chaff can be removed by using a fan or by
pouring them from one dish to another where the
wind is blowing. Look them over carefully, removing
defective nuts and foreign substances.</p>

<p>The next step is to grind them. The most practical
family mill we know of for grinding nuts, etc.,
is the Quaker City Mill (see cut and description of
same in this book).</p>

<p>Always grind freshly cooked nuts, as they do not
make good butter when left a day or two after being
cooked.</p>


<h3>PROCESS NO. 2</h3>

<p>Thoroughly heat the nuts in an oven, but do not
let them brown. Allow them to cool, then blanch
as described in process No. 1. Boil them from three
to four hours, until they are tender. Drain, spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
out on tins, and thoroughly dry them; then grind
them through the mill.</p>


<h3>PROCESS NO. 3</h3>

<p>Heat and blanch the same as for No. 2. Grind
them through a meat chopper or the nut butter mill
loosely adjusted. Then cook them in a steam cooker
about four hours. When tender, drain, spread on
tins, and thoroughly dry them. Then run them
through the mill tightly adjusted.</p>


<h3>SALTED NUT BUTTER</h3>

<p>Prepare nuts as described in process No. 1.
Sprinkle salt on the kernels when grinding. It is
much more preferable to grind the salt in with the
nuts than to mix it in the butter.</p>


<h3>ALMOND BUTTER</h3>

<p>Almond butter is more difficult to make than peanut
butter, on account of the difficulty in removing
the skins. Dry heat does not loosen the skins as it
does the peanut. To blanch almonds, soak them in
boiling water from two to five minutes; then the
skins become loose and can be pinched off by pressing
on the nut with the thumb and finger; the skins
will crack and the kernel pop out. Dry them in a
slow oven until they become thoroughly dry and
crisp, taking care not to burn them. Then grind
them through a loosely adjusted mill. Place on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
tins or on a cloth stretched over the stove until perfectly
dry. Then grind then in the nut butter mill
tightly adjusted.</p>

<p>This makes excellent butter if the almonds are
first-class and sweet.</p>


<h3>BRAZIL NUT BUTTER</h3>

<p>Remove the brown, woody skins with a sharp
knife and put the nuts through the mill. They may
have to be broken up before they can be ground. This
butter is very good, but somewhat expensive. It is
cheaper to buy the nuts already shelled.</p>


<h3>PEANUT MEAL</h3>

<p>Heat the peanuts sufficiently to remove the skins,
but do not brown them. Blanch and look over.
Boil or steam them until tender, taking care to have
them quite dry when done. Drain off all the water
possible and put them through a colander. Put on
tins suspended over the stove, or in a slow oven,
with the door open, taking care not to brown them.
When perfectly dry and hard, grind through the
mill loosely adjusted. If it is not fine enough,
spread out to dry some more, pass through the mill
again more tightly adjusted, but if the mill is too
tight, it will grind it into butter. A good plan is
to rub it through a flour sieve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>


<h3>NUT BUTTER FOR THE TABLE</h3>

<p>Put one-half the amount of butter required for
the meal into a bowl and dilute with an equal quantity
of water, adding a little of the water at a time,
beating it thoroughly with a fork until it is smooth
and light. Enough water should be used to make it
the proper consistency to spread nicely. An egg
beater or wire potato masher is an excellent utensil
for mixing. A little salt can be added if desired.
Nut butter when mixed with water does not keep but
a few hours.</p>


<h3>PEANUT CREAM</h3>

<p>Cook the peanuts until they just begin to turn
brown. Then make into butter, ground as fine as
possible. Emulsify with water until it is the consistency
of milk. Then put in double boiler and
cook until it has become as thick as ordinary cream.
A little salt can be added if desired. Serve it hot
or cold as preferred. It can be made into milk by
adding a little water.</p>

<p class="ad01 drop-capn"><span class="smcap">This</span> mill is tinned and has a ball bearing. Grinds
dry, wet or oily substances. Weight ten pounds,
capacity five pounds peanut butter per hour. This
is not a cheap meat mill which will not grind fine,
but a thoroughly practical grinding mill constructed
on the same principles as our large mills, which
have been used so successfully throughout the world for
nearly a generation. It is a general grinding mill for family
use, and is sold at a price within the reach of every family.
The importance of pure food can not be overestimated. The
surest way to get it is to do your own grinding, thus
having the article freshly ground as you use it, and avoiding
the danger of injurious adulterations. This mill is adapted
to grinding or pulverizing any of the following <span class="locked">articles:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="ad01">Coffee, peanuts or nuts of any kind, all wet or oily substances,
corn meal, cracker dust, bread crumbs, cracked wheat
and oats, horseradish, and cooked meats, spices, herbs, and
roots, vanilla beans and pods when mixed with sugar and
ground together for flavoring; raisins, with or without seeds
for marmalade, cocoanuts, etc. Peanut butter is said to be
superior to codliver oil for consumptives. Send for circular
containing directions for making peanut butter.</p>
